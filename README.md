### 👋🏾

My name is Daniel, and I am an engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. I have a love for the web and its relevant technologies, and I spend a lot of time [writing](https://www.danieleta.com/technical) about the tools that make me especially happy. Right now, I'm building software for [Mazi Mobility](https://www.mazimobility.com/), a Kenyan e-mobility startup that aims to transform the transportation sector on the continent.
